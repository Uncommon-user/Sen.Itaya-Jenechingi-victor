<p style="font-weight: bold; margin: auto;">
My name is Jenechingi Itaya, a passionate youth leader, student advocate, and visionary committed to positive change and academic excellence.<br/> I believe that leadership is not about position, but about service, integrity, and the courage to stand for what is right.<br/>

I am driven by a deep desire to see students rise beyond limitations, discover their purpose, and contribute meaningfully to society.<br/> My journey has been shaped by discipline, resilience, and a strong moral foundation.<br/> I strive to inspire others through action, honesty, and dedication.

I stand for unity, progress, and opportunity for all. <br/>My goal is to create an environment where every student feels heard, supported, and empowered to succeed.<br/> Together, we can build a future based on knowledge, respect, and shared responsibility.

This is not just about me—it is about us and the future we are determined to create.</p>
